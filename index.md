# About

Modern engineering workflows are built on computational tools for specifying models and designs, 
for numerical analysis of system behavior, and for optimization, model-fitting and rational design. 
How can machine learning be used to empower the engineer?

Emerging machine learning methods show promise as building blocks for accelerating these workflows and improving these computational tools: 
e.g., learned emulators for physical simulations or finite element models, 
generative models of 3d objects, 
and ML-driven methods for efficient design optimization. 
However, many questions remain to be answered before these methods become practically useful. 

Examples of research topics we wish to see addressed include, but are not limited to:
- Learning surrogate and reduced-order models for physical simulators which reduce computational costs while maintaining accuracy against strong baselines,
- Ensuring learned surrogates reliably generalize across scenarios for which they might be used, and provide error estimates and measures of uncertainty,
- Using machine learning to accelerate design optimization, or system identification and control, while respecting constraints, remaining robust to model or simulator error, and producing designs, estimators and policies which are practical in the real world,
- Developing ML tools which can assist design engineers to more effectively specify, explore and evaluate a space of possible designs,
- Using ML to accelerate fast prototyping and decentralized or additive manufacturing,
- Integrating ML tools with preexisting engineering tools and workflows to minimize friction and draw benefits from both old and new,
- Development of software and libraries which enable all of the above,
- Identification of applications and pressing challenges/opportunities, related or unrelated to the above points, in the application of ML to engineering workflows.

Our goals are to ''bridge the divide" between the engineering and machine learning communities, and to provide a venue for discussion of challenges and promising emerging methods for applying ML to engineering.

# Calls
We welcome submission of papers as well as proposals for tutorials, demonstrations, and discussions to hold during the workshop.
    
All calls share the following dates:
- Submission deadline: Oct 02, 2020
- Author notification: Oct 30, 2020

Websites for submission will be posted closer to the date.

## Call for papers
Papers may be submitted on:
- original completed research or high-quality work-in-progress
- investigations or expositions of open problems or important phenomena
- datasets
- reviews/synthesis of recent work
- written tutorials on important concepts
- anything else relevant to our topics and of interest to the community 

Papers must be formatted according to the NeurIPS 2020 style. 
There is a hard maximum of 6 pages (excluding references or supplementary materials). Shorter is better: we encourage authors to use as few pages as they can, while adequately explaining their work and topic.
    
Reviewing will be double-blind, so all papers must be anonymized.

Papers must not have been previously presented or accepted for presentation at an archival venue. However, this workshop is non-archival, and papers submitted to this workshop may be (concurrently or later) submitted to an archival venue.


## Call for tutorials
Tutorials should be 30-45 minute hands-on mini-hackathons or demonstrator-led interactive sessions with specific software or methods: examples might include tutorials on classical subjects like the adjoint approach to PDE-constrained optimization or the basics of design with CAD software, as well as  interactive  demos / coding  sessions focussed on recent work, such as recently released libraries or recently published methods. 

Submissions should be two-page extended abstracts, formatted according to the NeurIPS style. Reviewing will be single-blind.

Submitted abstracts should describe:
- the content which the tutorial will cover
- how this will be covered (e.g. interactive coding, live instructor demonstration, ...)
- intended audience of the tutorial, and how this will be relevant to them
- a concrete description of how the tutorial will run virtually and the technology platforms used
- any relevant experience or background of the presenters


## Call for demonstrations
Demonstrations should be interactive virtual experiences which showcase novel technology. The audience should be able to experience the demonstration in a brief time period - whether by "dropping in" for a few minutes, or by attending a short, regularly scheduled session. Interaction with the audience is a crucial element.

Submissions should be two-page extended abstracts, formatted according to the NeurIPS style. Reviewing will be single-blind.

Submitted abstracts should describe:
- the technology demonstrated
- the elements of novelty
- the audience-interactive part
- whether the demonstration will run in an asynchronous "drop in" fashion or with scheduled sessions
- a concrete description of how the demo will run virtually and the technology platforms used



## Call for discussions
Discussions will take place in a 30-45 minute facilitated round-table format. Topics should be of interest to the community, and should encourage building connections and collaborations across attendees.

Example topics include open research problems, the connections or differences between specific techniques used by different communities, discussions about how research is done or how communities interact, or anything else which meets the aforementioned goals.

Authors of accepted discussion topics will be expected to help facilitate and take part in the discussion (possibly alongside organizers or other experts).

Submissions should be one-to-two-page extended abstracts, formatted according to the NeurIPS style. Reviewing will be single-blind.

Submitted abstracts should describe:
- the topic of discussion
- any relevant background material
- why it is of interest to this community
- different perspectives that different sub-communities might bring to the table
- how it might encourage building connections and collaborations
- any relevant experience or background of the authors
