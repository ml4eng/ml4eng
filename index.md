# About
<font size="6">
Modern engineering workflows are built on computational tools for specifying models and designs, 
for numerical analysis of system behavior, and for optimization, model-fitting and rational design. 
How can machine learning be used to empower the engineer?

Emerging machine learning methods show promise as building blocks for accelerating these workflows and improving these computational tools: 
e.g., learned emulators for physical simulations or finite element models, 
generative models of 3d objects, 
and ML-driven methods for efficient design optimization. 
However, many questions remain to be answered before these methods become practically useful. 

Examples of research topics we wish to see addressed include, but are not limited to:
- Learning surrogate and reduced-order models for physical simulators which reduce computational costs while maintaining accuracy against strong baselines,
- Ensuring learned surrogates reliably generalize across scenarios for which they might be used, and provide error estimates and measures of uncertainty,
- Using machine learning to accelerate design optimization, or system identification and control, while respecting constraints, remaining robust to model or simulator error, and producing designs, estimators and policies which are practical in the real world,
- Developing ML tools which can assist design engineers to more effectively specify, explore and evaluate a space of possible designs,
- Using ML to accelerate fast prototyping and decentralized or additive manufacturing,
- Integrating ML tools with preexisting engineering tools and workflows to minimize friction and draw benefits from both old and new,
- Development of software and libraries which enable all of the above,
- Identification of applications and pressing challenges/opportunities, related or unrelated to the above points, in the application of ML to engineering workflows.

Our goals are to ''bridge the divide" between the engineering and machine learning communities, and to provide a venue for discussion of challenges and promising emerging methods for applying ML to engineering.

# Call for papers
We welcome submission papers on subjects related to the workshop topics consisting of:
- original completed research or high-quality work-in-progress
- investigations of open problems or important phenomena
- datasets or benchmarks
- position papers
- reviews/synthesis of recent work
- written tutorials or expositions of important concepts
- anything else relevant to our topics and of interest to the community 

Relevant dates:
- Submission deadline: Oct 02, 2020
- Author notification: Oct 30, 2020
- Camera ready deadline: Nov 23, 2020

Submissions should be short anonymized papers up to 4 pages (excluding references and supplementary materials) formatted according to the NeurIPS 2020 style. 
While you may submit supplementary material or appendices, all essential details should be in the main paper, as reviewers are not required to read this supplementatry material.
    
Papers must not have been previously presented or accepted for presentation at an archival venue. However, this workshop is non-archival, and papers submitted to this workshop may be (concurrently or later) submitted to an archival venue.

Accepted works will be presented as virtual posters, with an accopmanying 5-minute pre-recorded video. At least one author of each accepted work must register for the NeurIPS workshops and attend the virtual poster session.
